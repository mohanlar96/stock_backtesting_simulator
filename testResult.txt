I backtest on mid cap vs big company -> in both long term ( 10 years) , short term ( 5 years) , big companies win

Distribute your portfolio vs put everythin in for big companies ( everything in wins )

Max loss percentage seen -17 % 

Always use SMA (entry 200) and exit should be less than 200 maybe 100 ?? 

Let's stick with 21 days SMA .
